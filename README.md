<p><h4>Dater is Tinder type application where i tried to duplicate some tinder UI using SwiftUI. I was trying to learn swiftui and the best way is to create some application so i choose application which is rich by user experince and interface. Learn alot building this application. It has custom transition using namespace with number of gesture controls. Sheet presentation and much more. You can explore the code on github</h4></p>

It is build using SwiftUI. Its fun to play with Swiftui.It starts slow and By the end, youâ€™ll be able to create stunning graphics for your apps.
